## **Introduction**

This week I completed Project #1 (Exploring Cancer and Nitrate) and I've spent a little time thinking about Project #2.

## **1) Skills & Strategies**

Because the majority of the work left on Project #1 was front-end, I really had to use my web programming skills to my fullest. I figured out how to have Flask serve an Angular build, and from there I built out the app interface with Bootstrap and Leaflet.

## **2) Processes & Steps**

My process for completing Project #1 was as follows:

1. Finish the app
2. Write the paper
3. Record the demo

Each step was essentially required before the prior, as I needed a finished product to write a paper about, and having a written paper really helped me come up with lines for the video demo.

## **3) Challenges & Contingencies**

Recording the video and reviewing my knowledge of interpreting regression results were my two biggest challenges. I had no contingencies for them as they needed to happen. Thankfully I was able to do both with the help of extra online research.

## **4) What's Next**

Next I start working on Project #2. The second project is to make a park map intended for visitors. I already know that I want to do my map on Huntley Meadows, my favorite place to go birding (bird watching) in the Washington D.C. area.
