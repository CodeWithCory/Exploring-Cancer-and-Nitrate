<h2 id="introduction"><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
<p>This week I completed Project #1 (Exploring Cancer and Nitrate) and I've spent a little time thinking about Project #2.</p>
<h2 id="1-skills--strategies"><strong>1) Skills &amp; Strategies</strong></h2>
<p>Because the majority of the work left on Project #1 was front-end, I really had to use my web programming skills to my fullest. I figured out how to have Flask serve an Angular build, and from there I built out the app interface with Bootstrap and Leaflet.</p>
<h2 id="2-processes--steps"><strong>2) Processes &amp; Steps</strong></h2>
<p>My process for completing Project #1 was as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Finish the app</li>
<li>Write the paper</li>
<li>Record the demo</li>
</ol>
<p>Each step was essentially required before the prior, as I needed a finished product to write a paper about, and having a written paper really helped me come up with lines for the video demo.</p>
<h2 id="3-challenges--contingencies"><strong>3) Challenges &amp; Contingencies</strong></h2>
<p>Recording the video and reviewing my knowledge of interpreting regression results were my two biggest challenges. I had no contingencies for them as they needed to happen. Thankfully I was able to do both with the help of extra online research.</p>
<h2 id="4-whats-next"><strong>4) What's Next</strong></h2>
<p>Next I start working on Project #2. The second project is to make a park map intended for visitors. I already know that I want to do my map on Huntley Meadows, my favorite place to go birding (bird watching) in the Washington D.C. area.</p>
