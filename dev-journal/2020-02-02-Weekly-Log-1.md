# Weekly Log #1

**Cory Leigh Rahman** | University of Wisconsin-Madison, Master's in GIS & Web Map Programming, GEOG 777: Capstone in GIS Development

## Introduction

This is the first of 10 weekly logs documenting my progress through GEOG 777. The class consists of two large projects/challenges. The first challenge is to analyze the spatial relationship between cancer risk and nitrate concentration in drinking water using linear regression, then create an application allowing anyone to explore the relationship themselves.

> *Please address the following items in the weekly logs: 1) Identify the needs for skills and strategies in integrating the concepts and the solutions; 2) Reflect the processes/steps in solving the problems in the project; 3) Report any challenges and possible solutions even if it fails; 4) Make a plan for the next iteration.*

## 1) Skills & Strategies

Solving this challenge will require a diverse set of skills:

- Statistical geospatial analysis
- Full-stack web development

## 2) Processes & Steps

## 3) Challenges & Contingencies

## 4) What's Next
