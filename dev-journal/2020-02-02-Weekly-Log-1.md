# Weekly Log #1

**Cory Leigh Rahman** | University of Wisconsin-Madison, Master's in GIS & Web Map Programming, GEOG 777: Capstone in GIS Development

## **Introduction**

This is the first of 10 weekly logs documenting my progress through GEOG 777. The class consists of two large projects/challenges. 

> *Please address the following items in the weekly logs: 1) Identify the needs for skills and strategies in integrating the concepts and the solutions; 2) Reflect the processes/steps in solving the problems in the project; 3) Report any challenges and possible solutions even if it fails; 4) Make a plan for the next iteration.*

### Challenge #1 

The first challenge is to analyze the spatial relationship between cancer risk and nitrate concentration in drinking water using linear regression, then create an application allowing anyone to explore the relationship themselves.

## **1) Skills & Strategies**

Solving this challenge will require a diverse set of skills including but not limited to:

- Statistical geospatial analysis
- Full-stack web development
- Cartographic UX/UI design

Initial list of technologies I plan on using (tech stack):

- `Leaflet`     (Interactive mapping interface)
- `Angular`     (Front-end JavaScript framework)
- `NPM`         (Front-end package manager)
- `Flask`       (Back-end Python web framework)
- `Pip`         (Python package manager)
- `Anaconda`    (Used for Python environment management)
- `pysal`       (Geostatistical analysis)
- `Heroku`      (Platform / host)
- `VS Code`     (IDE / code editor)

## **2) Processes & Steps**

Initial Plan: 

1. **Initialize GIT Repo** (Initially for notes & brainstorming; later for code source control)
2. **Architect Tech Stack** (Determine which technologies will work together to solve the problem)
3. **Test Statistical Analysis** (Perform linear regression to explore the relationship between cancer and nitrate)
4. **Build Back-end** (Make server to perform geostatistical analysis on-the-fly)
5. **Build Front-end** (Map-based web interface for anyone to be able to explore the statistical analysis)

The first step I focused on this week was planning architecture, e.g. my "stack" (listed in #1)

## **3) Challenges & Contingencies**

My two biggest challenges will be 1) performing the statistical analysis, and 2) utilizing technologies I have not used before. I hope to perform the statistical analysis using pysal, but if that doesn't work out I'll try using QGIS. The technologies I'm least familiar with besides pysal are Flask and Anaconda, so if those don't work out then I can try using Node.js, which I am more comfortable with.

## **4) What's Next**

Now that I have my tech stack brainstormed, I'll attempt performing the most important part of this process: the statistical analysis. Once I've successfully performed the statistical analysis, I'll see if I can do it in a web backend so that I can build a web application on top of it.
